      "Penny reached for her holographic tablet. Again. He’d done it again. At her tender age, Penny should be thinking about school, debate society, boys... Anything, but Uncle Gadget. Her grades were suffering: she’d never had a ‘B+’ before, particularly not in Comp-Sci. She could program fluently in six languages and hack the Pentagon. So HOW did SHE get a ‘B+’? Gadget. She fell asleep 14 minutes into the hour, all of her answers right...and then blank. Her professor didn’t know about her secret life, of course. Just assumed she’d been out too late with friends the night before or online gaming. But, no. It was Thursday and already she’d been up late three nights in a row fixing Gadget’s mistakes and saving the world YET AGAIN from Dr Claw and his evil, but decidedly cute, cat. Uncle Gadget was loyal. He took care of her. Let her see a world other kids her age and even most adults would never know existed: Dr Claw’s shadow cabal. Penny knew she should fear Claw, but he played by the rules of logic. Claw was smart. Each villainous plan was carefully engineered. She hated to admit it, but she admired the thought he put into his work. Defeating him was challenging to be sure, but also kind of fun. Each new case was a problem to crack. Despite her youth, Penny had years of experience under her belt and a mind to match. She could defeat Claw, and for the most part, did. But Uncle Gadget was another matter entirely. Before she died, Mom used to say her brother, Gadget, was ‘a bit special’. Kind heart, but not the brightest bulb. Which must have been tough growing up in a family with several Nobel Prize winners, 314 patents, and a global computing empire. And that was just among Mom, Uncle Bob, Grandpa, and Grandma. To be sure, Gadget benefited from ‘off books’ funding from the family empire. There was no other way he could finance his crazy detective business before Penny started as an intern once he took over her care. Who would pay for Gadget’s ‘uneven’ results? And it was these ‘uneven results’ that were now killing her. Penny was nothing if not rational. Evil plots that could be foiled in a couple hours after school were drawn out because Gadget insisted on testing his latest stupid invention on each caper. The moronic umbrella parachute hat. His idiotic extendable arms. Whatever he could hide under his beige trench coat. The coat was really the source of many of Penny’s problems. If she could just see in advance what latest ‘gadget’ her Uncle was bringing to the battle, she could have planned around it. But no, Gadget liked to surprise her. His grand unveilings would be the death of her, if she wasn’t careful. The proverbial wrench in each of Penny’s carefully-crafted counter plans. Decrypting Claw’s latest plan from his AES-256 bit system was a cakewalk. It helped, of course, that Penny’s Uncle Bob had invented it. Then gather the requisite mission tools from Grandma’s top-secret advanced prototyping center. Pick up Uncle Gadget, as according to Gram, even the world’s greatest detective ‘needed a chaperone at age ten.’ Hop onto one of the family’s private supersonic jets to defeat Claw and get back in time for homework. Easy as pie, except the Gadget part. Much as she loved him, Uncle G always added hours Penny did not have to her missions. If she was going to complete her specially created combo Harvard undergrad / JD / MBA / Comp Sci and Criminology PHDs by 13, she really needed a bit more spare time... Maybe she could at least get Uncle G to ditch the coat and its myriad surprises. That should save an hour or two.\n"

Who would pay for Gadget’s ‘uneven’ results? \\n\\nAnd it was these ‘uneven results’ that were now killing her. Penny was nothing if not rational. Evil plots that could be foiled in a couple hours after school were drawn out because Gadget insisted on testing his latest stupid invention on each caper. The moronic umbrella parachute hat. His idiotic extendable arms. Whatever he could hide under his beige trench coat. \\n\\nThe coat was really the source of many of Penny’s problems. If she could just see in advance what latest ‘gadget’ her Uncle was bringing to the battle, she could have planned around it. But no, Gadget liked to surprise her. His grand unveilings would be the death of her, if she wasn’t careful. The proverbial wrench in each of Penny’s carefully-crafted counter plans. \\n\\nDecrypting Claw’s latest plan from his AES-256 bit system was a cakewalk. It helped, of course, that Penny’s Uncle Bob had invented it. Then gather the requisite mission tools from Grandma’s top-secret advanced prototyping center. Pick up Uncle Gadget, as according to Gram, even the world’s greatest detective ‘needed a chaperone at age ten.’ Hop onto one of the family’s private supersonic jets to defeat Claw and get back in time for homework. \\n\\nEasy as pie, except the Gadget part. Much as she loved him, Uncle G always added hours Penny did not have to her missions. \\n\\nIf she was going to complete her specially created combo Harvard undergrad / JD / MBA / Comp Sci and Criminology PHDs by 13, she really needed a bit more spare time...\\n\\nMaybe she could at least get Uncle G to ditch the coat and its myriad surprises. That should save an hour or two.\"\"\"\n",
